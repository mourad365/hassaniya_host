# Security Guide - Hassaniya Host

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Hassaniya Host application and provides guidelines for maintaining security in production.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Supabase Auth Integration**: Secure user authentication with email/password
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin-only access to management functions
- **Session Management**: Automatic session validation and expiry warnings
- **Protected Routes**: Server-side route protection with user verification
- **Email Confirmation**: Required email verification for admin access

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive client-side and server-side validation
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization to prevent cross-site scripting
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries via Supabase
- **File Upload Security**: Type, size, and content validation for uploads
- **Arabic Text Support**: Proper handling of RTL content with security

### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **Strict CSP Headers**: Prevents unauthorized script execution
- **Resource Whitelisting**: Only allows resources from trusted domains
- **Inline Script Protection**: Minimal use of inline scripts with nonces
- **Frame Protection**: Prevents clickjacking attacks

### 4. Network Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All traffic encrypted in production
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers
- **Rate Limiting**: Client-side and server-side request throttling

### 5. Data Protection
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored securely
- **API Key Management**: Proper key rotation and access control
- **Database Security**: Row-level security policies in Supabase
- **File Access Control**: Secure CDN configuration for media files

## Production Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables configured correctly
- [ ] API keys rotated and secured
- [ ] Database RLS policies active
- [ ] SSL certificates installed and configured
- [ ] Security headers implemented
- [ ] CSP policies tested and working
- [ ] File upload restrictions in place
- [ ] Admin accounts secured with strong passwords

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] HTTPS enforced on all pages
- [ ] Security headers present in response
- [ ] Authentication flows working correctly
- [ ] File uploads restricted properly
- [ ] Admin access limited to authorized users
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Logs configured for security monitoring

## Security Configurations

### 1. Supabase Security
```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE news ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE articles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE media ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Admin-only write policies
CREATE POLICY "Admin write access" ON news
FOR ALL USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin');

-- Public read policies
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON news
FOR SELECT USING (status = 'published');
```

### 2. Bunny CDN Security
- **Storage CDN**: Images only, no executable files
- **Video Library**: Secure video streaming with proper authentication
- **Access Keys**: Separate keys for storage and video library
- **CORS Settings**: Configured for application domain only

### 3. Environment Security
```bash
# Production environment variables
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_ENABLE_DEBUG=false
VITE_ENABLE_DEV_TOOLS=false
VITE_ENABLE_SOURCE_MAPS=false
```

## Security Monitoring

### 1. Error Tracking
- **Error Categorization**: Automatic error type detection
- **Security Event Logging**: Failed authentication attempts
- **Admin Activity Monitoring**: All admin actions logged
- **File Upload Monitoring**: Track upload attempts and failures

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- **API Response Times**: Monitor for unusual delays
- **CDN Usage**: Track bandwidth and request patterns
- **Database Performance**: Monitor query performance
- **User Session Tracking**: Detect unusual login patterns

### 3. Alerts & Notifications
- **Failed Login Attempts**: Alert on multiple failures
- **Unusual Upload Activity**: Monitor file upload patterns
- **Database Errors**: Alert on connection or query issues
- **CDN Overages**: Monitor usage limits

## Common Security Threats & Mitigations

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Threat**: Malicious scripts injected into content
**Mitigation**:
- Input sanitization on all user inputs
- CSP headers prevent inline script execution
- React's built-in XSS protection
- Proper escaping of dynamic content

### 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Threat**: Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of users
**Mitigation**:
- Supabase JWT token validation
- SameSite cookie settings
- Origin header validation
- User session verification

### 3. SQL Injection
**Threat**: Malicious SQL queries through user input
**Mitigation**:
- Supabase parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization
- No raw SQL queries in client code
- Database user with limited permissions

### 4. File Upload Attacks
**Threat**: Malicious files uploaded to server
**Mitigation**:
- File type validation
- File size limits
- Content scanning
- Secure file storage in CDN
- No executable file uploads

### 5. Authentication Bypass
**Threat**: Unauthorized access to protected resources
**Mitigation**:
- Proper session management
- Server-side authentication checks
- Route protection middleware
- Regular session validation

## Incident Response Plan

### 1. Security Incident Detection
- Monitor error logs for unusual patterns
- Set up automated alerts for security events
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- User reports of suspicious activity

### 2. Immediate Response
1. **Isolate**: Disconnect affected systems if necessary
2. **Assess**: Determine scope and impact of incident
3. **Contain**: Prevent further damage or data loss
4. **Document**: Record all actions and findings
5. **Communicate**: Notify stakeholders as appropriate

### 3. Recovery Process
1. **Patch**: Fix security vulnerabilities
2. **Update**: Rotate compromised credentials
3. **Restore**: Restore systems from clean backups
4. **Monitor**: Enhanced monitoring post-incident
5. **Review**: Conduct post-incident analysis

### 4. Prevention
1. **Update**: Regular security updates and patches
2. **Train**: Security awareness training for team
3. **Test**: Regular penetration testing
4. **Audit**: Security audits and code reviews
5. **Improve**: Implement lessons learned

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
2. **Authentication**: Never trust client-side authentication alone
3. **Authorization**: Check permissions on every request
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
5. **Logging**: Log security events for monitoring
6. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and secure

### For Administrators
1. **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege
2. **Key Management**: Regular rotation of API keys
3. **Monitoring**: Active security monitoring and alerting
4. **Backups**: Regular secure backups of data
5. **Updates**: Timely application of security updates
6. **Training**: Security awareness for all team members

### For Content Managers
1. **Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords
2. **Two-Factor Auth**: Enable 2FA where available
3. **Safe Browsing**: Be cautious with links and downloads
4. **Content Review**: Review uploaded content for safety
5. **Access Logs**: Regularly review access logs
6. **Reporting**: Report suspicious activity immediately
